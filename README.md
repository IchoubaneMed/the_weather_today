# the_weather_today

#### Video Demo: https://youtu.be/YduThxH4luc


this is a weather application based on the data provided by the OpenWeatherMap API, the languages used in this application are:

- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript
- Python


beside these languages, i have used flask as core for this application, and leaflet library in order to render the map
So the basic of this application is pretty simple, the user type the name of the city that he want to know its weather the he click the search button 
as a result the application shows the the current weather in celsius relative the city with its location on the map 

the application contains the following folders & files:

- static:
    - logo.png (was made in Inkscape)
    - logo.svg (was made in Inkscape)
    - style.css (file that contains style for the application: font, colors, layout etc)
- templates:
    - base.html (the file that cotains the html boilerplate)
    - index.html (this file is inherted from the html boilerplate)
- app.py: this file contains the python which means the flask code
